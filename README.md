# Bot Battlr
For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of available bots, among other features. 

## Website url
https://wk2-phase2-codechallenge-viktor-kangi.vercel.app/

## Built with
- javascript
- html
- css
- React 

## Setup
After unbundling the project:

1. cd bot-battlr
2. Run npm install in your terminal.
3. Run json-server --watch db.json. This will run your backend port.
4. In a new terminal, run npm start. This will run your React app

## Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the YourBotArmy component. The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does not disappear from the BotCollection.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the YourBotArmy component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the YourBotArmy on the frontend.

## Advanced Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- Choose if I want to enlist a bot into my army or just see their data. Clicking on the card should instead display a show view (BotSpecs) for that bot, which should replace BotsCollection. BotSpecs should have two buttons: one to go back to the list view and another to enlist that bot.
- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component, SortBar.
- When I enlist a bot it will be removed from the BotCollection and added to YourBotArmy.
- Filter bots by their class. We can select a few filters at the same time.
- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component, SortBar.
- Only enlist one bot from each bot_class. The classes are ["Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch"].
